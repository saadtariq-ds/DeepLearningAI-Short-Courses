The plush is incredibly soft and cute, and my daughter carries it everywhere with her. However, I did notice that one of the ears is slightly lower than the other, which seems like a manufacturing flaw rather than intentional design. Despite this minor issue, I found the size to be a bit smaller than expected given the price. I believe there are larger options available for the same cost. On the bright side, the plush arrived a day earlier than anticipated, allowing me to enjoy it myself before passing it on to my daughter. Overall, while there are some drawbacks, the quality and cuteness of this panda plush make it a worthwhile purchase for any panda enthusiast."
